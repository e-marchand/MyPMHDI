## as demo

Just launch the base, the form will be launched to edit this project dependencies.

## as component

First download this project in the parent folder of your base.

Then create in your project a file named `Project/Sources/dependencies.json` with this content:

```json
{"dependencies": { "PackageManagerJSONEditor": {}}}
```

And open your base (or restart if already started).

ðŸŽ‰ You could now launch the form to edit your project dependencies using the shared method `ShowPackageManagerForm`. ( [code example](DemoInstall.4dm))

> [!TIP]  
> You could execute this code in your base to create the file
```4d
Folder(fk database folder).file("Project/Sources/dependencies.json")\
.setText(JSON Stringify:C1217({dependencies: {PackageManagerJSONEditor: {}}}))
```

## TODO

- [ ]Â When adding a folder allow to have relative folder, maybe automatically if component base is in sibling folder or in base [code here](https://github.com/e-marchand/PackageManagerJSONEditor/blob/main/Project/Sources/Methods/AddDependencyPathToEnv.4dm#L22)
- [ ]Â When adding a folder allow to set a custom name
